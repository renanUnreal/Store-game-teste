# Store-game-teste
Mechanical test of movement and store with purchase and sale of items

the project has dynamic items manually inserted in the store system 
to only simulate the purchase and sale of the same, because for the 
store to operate dynamically it would be necessary to create a list of 
data storage and another to define items contained in the game, and this would take longer
